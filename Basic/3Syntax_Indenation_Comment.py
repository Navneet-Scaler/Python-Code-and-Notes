Python Syntax
1.Python has simple and clean syntax, making it highly readable. Key rules include:
2.Case-sensitive: name and Name are different variables.
3.Statements and Line Breaks: Each statement is typically written on a new line.
End of Statement: No semicolon (;) is needed, although it can be used optionally.

Indentation
1.Python uses indentation to define blocks of code instead of braces {} or keywords.
2.Each level of indentation must be consistent (spaces or tabs).

Comments
Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter and are used for documentation.
